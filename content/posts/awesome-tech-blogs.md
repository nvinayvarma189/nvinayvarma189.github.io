I wanted to have a place to record all the amazing tech blog posts that I keep going back to. These are the kinds of posts that I have learned a lot from and I can't make it bette even if I write it in my own words. If I can, one day, write a technical blog post that is as good as any of these, I will be so satisfied.

According to me, a good technical blog post is one that:
1. Answers the question "why should I care about this" before answering "how to do this".
2. Starts with a simple case and builds on complexity.
3. Draws parallels with real life examples.
4. Assumes reader is a monkey with a mouse brain.

All of the below posts have some or all of the above qualities:
