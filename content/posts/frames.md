Each of these frames make me feel something I struggle to put into words. Each one a different feeling. I've decided to document as it helps in crystallization and reinforcement of thoughts/emotions (which, I believe, is key to developing taste). Hence this is also a practice of self-awareness.

**The Goodbye**

This is from a scene in Life of Pi where Pi is meeting Anandi for the last time. I've looked at this frame long enough to derive a (perhaps non-existent) meaning. There are two main elements at play here: the anxiety-inducing unrest of the sea (emoted by pi in the preceding frame) and the reassuring solidity of the bridge (emoted by Anandi in this frame) supporting the depiction of both uncertainty and hope in a single moment.

Photographically, the placement of the actors in the center left to not conceal the convergence of the bridge is great! The colors, the contrast, and the natural light falling from the right adds to the scene.
 
All of this stitched together, I think, produces the intended feeling of a sinking heart.

**Dust Storm**

There lies a grand, horror fantasy, tragedy, revenge, flavored movie somewhere in this image. I like how the pots are completely back and none of the faces can be seen. It adds a mystic vibe to it. If ever I write a book or direct a movie, I want to do one with exactly this vibe.

**Little Cattle in Bhutan**

This picture always sparks a wonder in me and makes me think what would life look like if I was one of those kids. How would that innocence look on me? What are their biggest dreams and what are they afraid of the most? Do they think life is short or long?

**Surfing Sunset**

It takes me back to this one time I was in Mulki learning to surf in the morning and was swimming in the backwaters in the evening. There was a time when the craving to adopt a lifestyle of adventure sport as my early morning activity had a strong hold on me. It still does. But I can sense that its power has greatly reduced. It happens when you don't act on such cravings right away and leave it for time (as a concept) to devour.

**Only way is ahead**

Makes me think of a small town boy, burdened/awarded with responsibilities early in life. He is just 20 and has the confidence that everything is figured out for him. The long road on his back is filled with small happinesses for himself and large sacrifices he made for his loved ones.

Absolutely love the monotone on this one.

**Catapult into the Gold**

What a breathtaking shot this is! Every time I see this, I can't help but imagine myself as him and looking down while plunging into the massive ocean. This also evokes a major part of the same emotion from the 3rd picture. I guess I really like being in the water. Ironic thing to say who can't swim to save his life. But I don't let it dampen my imagination self of being a water baby.
