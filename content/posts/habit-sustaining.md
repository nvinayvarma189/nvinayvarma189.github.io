# Why are Habits important?

# Sustaining a Habit

### Why do people give up?
There is a misconception that people give up because of lazyness. There is no such thing as lazyness. There is only interest and the lack of it. There is often a reason to give up on something. Actually there are multiple different ones.

1. This is boring
2. The reward I get in return is not worth it
3. This is not important for me
4. It is very hard to do.

### What to give up What not to give up
"Never give up" has to be in the running for the most cliched statements of all time. Does it have value? yes, certainly. Does it have value all the time? We'll see.

There are a lot of qoutations on the internet that insipre you to be better. Sometimes they conflict with each other often leaving you with not knowing which one to follow. "No matter what, never Give up" v/s "A smart person knows when to give up". I want to go on a tangent here to rant about a dissatisfaction of mine: Everybody talks about the qoute but they never include the context in which the qoute arised from. Alas it is left for you to experience.

Looping back, 

You can give up on the means to achieve a goal. But do not give up on the goal itself. Giving up on the goal means you have decided that something is not important for you. Your personality (the type of person you identify yourself as) has changed. It pays to be gritty about what personality you want to develop.


### How to develop passion?

**What does it mean to be passionate about something?**
Being passionate means

**Sources of passion**
Purusit of Fame, Wanting to be different



**How many things can you be passionate about?**

With the risk of oversimplification, everyone can relate to one of the below:
1. Passionate about a single thing
2. Passionate about a lot of things
3. Passionate about nothing

Some are lucky to find something there are passionate about quite early in life. There are many others who don't. Like me. They have multiple fleeting interests and are overwhelmed by the desire to do everything right now.  If you identify to be this person, you may find some comfort in reading Susan Flower's post.

how did I escape it? Honestly, I don't know how. I think I was finally tired of trying to be everything. I asked myself why do I want to do everything right now. Would it make a difference for me if I became a guitarist when I'm young v/s when I'm 40 years old? If the answer was yes, It is probably because the prime motivation is coming from wanting to impress others and wanting to be cool.

It took me years of juggling multiple things for short periods of time. I was never the top candidate in a field of interest. At some point it occurred to me that being a master in one thing would be more fun

Fuck around and find out is a cliched advice but I found it to be gold. Say yes to a lot of things and then 

## Importance of passion
It is difficult to remain on track when you see no logic in what you do. It is much easier to sustain a habit when you have a strong reason to do it. But being passionate is not enough. Even those who achievetd mastery did so with a combination of passion and preserverance.

One of the reasons why people procrastinate is becuase of the availability of instant gratification. When you have a task to do and there is a new video released by your favourite content creator,

Every such small decision is a vote for the type of person you want to be. Being reminded about why something is important for you helps you win over your urge to give in to instant gratification.

For instance, "I want to go to badminton everyday. why is that? I strive to take care of my body. Why is that? A healthy body lets me puruse things even when I'm older."

Passion is a productivity hack. I wonder why none of the TODO list apps (atleast the ones that I'm aware of) do not have a way for people to build their goals in hierachies so that they form a narrative.

Imagine you see items on your to-do list, you click on an item and you see the reason(often a higher level goal) why it is on your to-do list. Then it chains all the up to a top level goal. Such a type of organising, in my opinion, will help you reassure that you know what you are doing and most importantly "Why" you are doing it.

Following such a framework would help you become the person you want to be or it will show that you actually are not doing what you are supposed to be doing. If the latter happens, it is a good thing to get back to the drawing board and reflect upon yourself.

Please note that this framework is not immune to deviations and the crap that life throws at you. There will always be uncertainities and you will have to re-prioritise. Something always comes up as life happens (You relocated to new a place and there is no facility to play badminton). You can always change the means (joining a Gym instead) by which you achieve your top level goal (being fit).

## Environment Matters

By Environment I mean: The rigidity of your schedule, proximity of work and hobby places, affordability of pursuing an activity, etc.

Humans are great at adapting to situations. Where lecturing fails in getting you to do something, necessity can succeed.

Imagine you are someone who always struggled to be on time and your boss of your new job said "You are fired the first day you are late", do you think things will change? yes. Will it be easy? No. However, now that you are REQUIRED to do something, you have a strong reason to do something. Ofcourse such an amount of tightness (no room for error at all) is no good for habit building (we shall see more on this in #Compassion section). With the right amount of tightness in the situation, you can extract the best out of you. How to achieve this balance on the spectrum of flexibility? mess around and find out.

Being able to craft your environmet is also a privilage. Example: Having a personal trainer come to your home to help you stay on course. Not everyone can afford such a thing. However, there are more things in your hand than you think. Analyze how can you craft your environment such that there is minimum friction to pursue your interests.

This doesn't mean, you don't take responsibility, instead, the burden of consistency shifts from your limited amount of will power to an environment that is crafted to your own advantage. Necessity is the mother of motivation too. Atleast in my case, I've seen that too much flexibility stalls growth as I get too comfortable in my shoes.

## Habit Stacking

## Measuring Progress

## Compassion
Compassion for habit forming. Most people overestimate what they can do in 1 year and understimate what they can do in 10 years. Do not beat yourself for bad days. Bad days are part of the process.

You are allowed to give up due to lack of results. But never give up because you are discouraged.
