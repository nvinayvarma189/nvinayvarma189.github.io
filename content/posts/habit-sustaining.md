# Why are Habits important?

# Sustaining a Habit

### How to develop passion?

**What does it mean to be passionate about something?**
Being passionate means

**Sources of passion**
Purusit of Fame, Wanting to be different



**How many things can you be passionate about?**

With the risk of oversimplification, everyone can relate to one of the below:
1. Passionate about a single thing
2. Passionate about a lot of things
3. Passionate about nothing

Some are lucky to find something there are passionate about quite early in life. There are many others who don't. Like me. They have multiple fleeting interests and are overwhelmed by the desire to do everything right now.  If you identify to be this person, you may find some comfort in reading Susan Flower's post.

how did I escape it? Honestly, I don't know how. I think I was finally tired of trying to be everything. I asked myself why do I want to do everything right now. Would it make a difference for me if I became a guitarist when I'm young v/s when I'm 40 years old?

Every such small decision is a vote for the type of person you want to be. Being reminded about why something is important for you helps you win over your urge to give in to instant gratification.

A TODO list that forms a narrative.

For instance, I wan to go to badminton everyday. why is that? Why is that? I strive to take care of my body. Wjy is that? A healthy body lets me puruse things even when I'm older.

Following such a framework would help you become the person you want to be or it will show that you actually are not doing what you are supposed to be doing. If the latter happens, it is a good thing to get back to the drawing board and reflect upon yourself.

Please note that this framework is not immune to deviations and the shit that life throws at you. There will always be uncertainities and you will have to re-prioritise. Something always comes up as life happens. You can always edit the low level goals.

## Compassion
Compassion for habit forming. Most people overestimate what they can do in 1 year and understimate what they can do in 10 years. Do not beat yourself for bad days. Bad days are part of the process.

You are allowed to give up due to lack of results. But never give up because you are discouraged.
