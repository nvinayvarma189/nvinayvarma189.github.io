# Why am I writing this?
I often have phases where I'm super productive and when I'm in an absolute rut. I'm not in control of this situation and I figured I should be doing somehting about it. I currently am in a good phase where I'm able to get things (not just the ones I have to do, even the ones I want to do) done. I've been reading some self-help books and also have been experimenting a few things around my routine and I'm feeling in control. I want to document this feeling of being in control and write down the things I'm doing to stay this way. This is a condensed form of all that I learnt so that it is helpful for my future self. If it helps you too, I'll be glad to know.

# Why are (Good) Habits important?
Many people get work done when there is a scary consequence of not doing something they ought to do. While they can get away with many such situations where they pulled an all-nighter to counter the weeks of procrastination, However, it results staying medicore. It doesn't challenge you to improve hence you never reach your maximum potential (which your future self would thank you for). It's like getting trapped in a local maxima.

In the initial years, there isn't much differnce between person A who is irregular versus person B who is hihgly consistent. The filed is more level grounded (It is relatively easier for A to catchup with B). However, in the long-term, the difference will be staggering. You can't compete with someone who has beem practicing something every day, understadning their weakness, and fine tuning their process for many years. 

# Sustaining a Habit

### Why do people give up?
There is a misconception that people give up because of lazyness. There is no such thing as lazyness. There is only interest and the lack of it. There is often a reason to give up on something. Actually there are multiple different ones.

1. This is boring
2. The reward I get in return is not worth it
3. This is not important for me
4. It is very hard to do.

### What to give up What not to give up
"Never give up" has to be in the running for the most cliched statements of all time. Does it have value? yes, certainly. Does it have value all the time? We'll see.

There are a lot of qoutations on the internet that insipre you to be better. Sometimes they conflict with each other often leaving you with not knowing which one to follow. "No matter what, never Give up" v/s "A smart person knows when to give up". I want to go on a tangent here to rant about a dissatisfaction of mine: Everybody talks about the qoute but they never include the context in which the qoute arised from. Alas it is left for you to experience.

Looping back, 

You can give up on the means to achieve a goal. But do not give up on the goal itself. Giving up on the goal means you have decided that something is not important for you. Your personality (the type of person you identify yourself as) has changed. It pays to be gritty about what personality you want to develop.


### How to develop passion?

**What does it mean to be passionate about something?**
Being passionate means

**Sources of passion**
Purusit of Fame, Wanting to be different


**How many things can you be passionate about?**

With the risk of oversimplification, everyone can relate to one of the below:
1. Passionate about a single thing
2. Passionate about a lot of things
3. Passionate about nothing

Some are lucky to find something there are passionate about quite early in life. There are many others who don't. Like me. They have multiple fleeting interests and are overwhelmed by the desire to do everything right now.  If you identify to be this person, you may find some comfort in reading Susan Flower's post.

how did I escape it? Honestly, I don't know how. I think I was finally tired of trying to be everything. I asked myself why do I want to do everything right now. Would it make a difference for me if I became a guitarist when I'm young v/s when I'm 40 years old? If the answer was yes, It is probably because the prime motivation is coming from wanting to impress others and wanting to be cool.

It took me years of juggling multiple things for short periods of time. I was never the top candidate in a field of interest. At some point it occurred to me that being a master in one thing would be more fun

Fuck around and find out is a cliched advice but I found it to be gold. Say yes to a lot of things and then.

## Importance of passion
It is difficult to remain on track when you see no logic in what you do. It is much easier to sustain a habit when you have a strong reason to do it. But being passionate is not enough. Even those who achievetd mastery did so with a combination of passion and preserverance.

One of the reasons why people procrastinate is becuase of the availability of instant gratification. When you have a task to do and there is a new video released by your favourite content creator, 


Every such small decision is a vote for the type of person you want to be. Being reminded about why something is important for you helps you win over your urge to give in to instant gratification.

For instance, "I want to go to badminton everyday. why is that? I strive to take care of my body. Why is that? A healthy body lets me puruse things even when I'm older."

Passion is a productivity hack. I wonder why none of the TODO list apps (atleast the ones that I'm aware of) do not have a way for people to build their goals in hierachies so that they form a narrative.

Imagine you see items on your to-do list, you click on an item and you see the reason(often a higher level goal) why it is on your to-do list. Then it chains all the up to a top level goal. Such a type of organising, in my opinion, will help you reassure that you know what you are doing and most importantly "Why" you are doing it.

Following such a framework would help you become the person you want to be or it will show that you actually are not doing what you are supposed to be doing. If the latter happens, it is a good thing to get back to the drawing board and reflect upon yourself.

Please note that this framework is not immune to deviations and the crap that life throws at you. There will always be uncertainities and you will have to re-prioritise. Something always comes up as life happens (You relocated to new a place and there is no facility to play badminton). You can always change the means (joining a Gym instead) by which you achieve your top level goal (being fit).

What should the following people do? How should they go about discovering passion?

They’ve been told to follow their passion, but they don’t feel especially passionate about anything. They’ve been told to let their strengths guide them, but they’re not sure what they’re best at. They may have felt they had answers in the past, but they’ve changed and they’re no longer sure who they are or where they’re going.

From [Nat's website](https://nat.org/), Enthusiasm matters! It might be easier to do big things than small things for this reason
## Environment Matters

By Environment I mean: The rigidity of your schedule, proximity of work and hobby places, affordability of pursuing an activity, etc.

Humans are great at adapting to situations. Where lecturing fails in getting you to do something, necessity can succeed.

Imagine you are someone who always struggled to be on time and your boss of your new job said "You are fired the first day you are late", do you think things will change? yes. Will it be easy? No. However, now that you are REQUIRED to do something, you have a strong reason to do something. Ofcourse such an amount of tightness (no room for error at all) is no good for habit building (we shall see more on this in #Compassion section). With the right amount of tightness in the situation, you can extract the best out of you. How to achieve this balance on the spectrum of flexibility? mess around and find out.

Being able to craft your environmet is also a privilage. Example: Having a personal trainer come to your home to help you stay on course. Not everyone can afford such a thing. However, there are more things in your hand than you think. Analyze how can you craft your environment such that there is minimum friction to pursue your interests.

This doesn't mean, you don't take responsibility, instead, the burden of consistency shifts from your limited amount of will power to an environment that is crafted to your own advantage. Necessity is the mother of motivation too. Atleast in my case, I've seen that too much flexibility stalls growth as I get too comfortable in my shoes.

An another human is great accountability partner. If they are your peers who also have similar goals, it is perfect.
What can you do to build a suitable environment?

## Beating Inertia is Hard
Execercising in the Gym is not hard, getting up and going to the Gym is. Reading everyday is not hard, keeping your phone down and opening a book is. These microdecisions are a vote for how you are going to spend the next 40 minutes (it is obvious when you think about it but it hard to realise when you are in the moment).

One tip is to make it easy for you start something. Often times we write down tasks that are too vague. Too much of uncertaininty is not pleasant. When you are looking at a task to pick up, you have to spend mental energy to disect the problem at that point. Imagine you are already in the middle of a work day. You are already a little worked up. The moment you have to spend the mental energy, you immediately do something else to shy away from this duanting task. You open social media and you do a couple of scrolls and 2 hours are gone. Instead if the task is already disected into small portions and the first step doesn't take more than 2 minutes, you are muck likely to start doing it. Once you start doing it, it is easy to continue doing it (unless you are in a very distracting environemnt). Even if you get distracted, it is easy for you to gain your focu back becuase the checklist item you are working on is well within your reach.

Your first step should ideally be as dumb as possible. It should be something that you can do without spending any mental energy. If you want to read 10 pages, your first step should be to reach out for the book and place it in front of you. That's it. That is all that is needed. Next you flip through pages and read the first sentence. 

When you write down tasks like "start job search", "write blog on habit sustaining" as you would assume is a daunting and mammoth task. I'm generally more motivated during the nights. So that is when I try to arrange my tasks for tomorrow and try to break them down into smaller checklists. The best time to do this is when you are adding this task in your to-do list itself. That is when the iron is hot (when you have the most context).

## Habit Stacking

The best cue to trigger the commencement of a habit is another person (posisblr because you are answerable to them and you need to have a dialogue with them). That is why having personal trainers is one of the best ways to sustain a habit. 

One example case where having a human as a habit partner/cue is that When you say you are tired or not feeling it, some trainers say just come and we will figure it out. This makes you wanna overcome the momentary friction. Once you reached the gym your mood changes you feel ready to go. These are some of the days I feel, I'm glad I came to the gym today.

## Measuring Progress

Attaching a reason to do a task helps but there will be times when you will be questioning your reason to do something. If you are not seeing results, you will feel discouraged. It is not okay to get discouraged. A strong sense of purpose and interest help you stick your habit in the beginnig. But that alone cannot make it sustain the habit. If you are not seeing results, it doesn't seem logical to pursure it. The same logical thinking that helped you get started is now working against you.

## Compassion
Compassion for habit forming. Most people overestimate what they can do in 1 year and understimate what they can do in 10 years. Do not beat yourself for bad days. Bad days are part of the process. 

You are allowed to give up due to lack of results. But never give up because you are discouraged.

Start giving advice to other people who are in similar situation. It is much easier to advice others. In a sense, you will be advicing yourself from 3rd person view. This can be very motivating.


I will give you some examples of what how I've become more consistent 

1. When I had the goal to read atleast 2 pages everyday, my success rate was 45%.
    1. Then I changed the goal from reading a book to going to the nearby library. Now I only had to optimise for going to the library(making the goal as the first step).
    2. The library is on the way to my office. So I planned in way that I go to the library and then go to office. (Habit Stacking)
    3. Once I go into the library, I know I will read. It has the perfect environmemt with many people also reading/working with focus. No energy goes into staying focused. It happens automatically. (Environment matters).
    4. On some days, things come up and I happen to miss practicing my habit. I tell myself it is fine, I don't want to kick myself and self-loath. I write down the reasons why I did not practice my hobby. Once I see a pattern in my failure reasons, I try to tackle it and not see. It gives me the confidence that I can figure it out. (compassion).

The success rate jumpted to 67%. What changed is now I only had to optimise for going to the library (the necessary steps are to).

Something I'm still trying to figure out and stop doing

I sometimes fall in a bing loop. All it takes is one moment of opening YT shorts and 2 hours are gone. I'm still trying to figure out what can I do instead of checking my phone whenever there is a 5-10 minute break.



When should you start optimising for performance more than just consistency? Initially, it should just be consistency.
