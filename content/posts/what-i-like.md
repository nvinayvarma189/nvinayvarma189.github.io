- A hot water bath on a cold winter evening. long and elaborate.
- When I finally understand a concept with enough nuance to deduce it from the hook line instead of needing to memorise it.
- Listening to a song that has great lyrical meaning. I like looping a song and studying the role of each word in conveying layered emotions. Always blows my mind.
    - I have a [playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2fJVGXwOl14ZXJtP7B1mBb?si=64e43cf381bf4b27) of songs like this.
- A non-hasty moment of lying on the bed to stretch out my arms and legs, taking in a deep breath, and then releasing the lock as I exhale.
- Head and neck massages. Best when mom/dad is doing it while we talk about the nothings of our lives.
- When I turn out to be useful to someone who I look up to and respect.
- A surprise day off.
- An uninterrupted time window to explore whatever natural compulsion I'm having without the sense of a deadline or an expectation of the outcome.
- Both, giving and receiving compliments.
- The warmth of close physical proximity (shoulder touching, hand locking, arms wrapping, gentle grip on the thighs) with my friends and family.
- A breezy evening at the beach just watching the waves crash and recede.
- The aftermath of making a clever, cheeky, punny joke that tickles or surprises everyone.

There are obviously more things I like, and I hope to document more as I experience them.
