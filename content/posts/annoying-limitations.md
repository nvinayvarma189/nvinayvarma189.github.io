I want to list down the things I do not like and there are no better alternatives for them(at least to my current knowledge). It is almost annoying that these limitations still exist.

The idea is that I can keep coming back to this list and check if creating a better alternative is within my capability and interest (at that point in time). I will keep adding more when I encounter more annoying and surprising (that something better doesn't exist yet) limitations.

**Here goes the list:**

1. I hate that there is **no easy way to alter the mobile experience** like we can alter the web surfing experience on desktops (Mac/Windows/Linux) via browser extensions.
2. I don’t like the concept of countries and national borders. I think it creates unnecessary (and additional) distinctions between members of the same species (homo sapiens). There has to be a **way to travel/interact/trade with people from other parts of world just like we do with people of the same country.**
3. I don’t like that there is **no good way to synchronize the reading progress of a physical book and a digital copy.** Also the lack of syncing highlights in a single place.
4. I find sleeping very boring. I wouldn’t want to go to sleep when there is so much to do and be engaged. Please note that I have this feeling not because I don’t find enough time to do my things. I believe 16 hours is good enough. I also love the freshness after a good night of sleep. **I just don’t like that it takes a human body 8 hours of time to do so.** Why isn’t there an alternative or initiative to reduce the amount of time it takes for the body to recover via sleeping?
