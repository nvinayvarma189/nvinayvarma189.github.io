        By profession, I do Platform ML work at <a href="https://skit.ai"
        target="_blank">Skit.ai</a>. It is a mix of Software Engineering, MLOps,
        and Deep Learning. In my spare time, I'm clearing my never ending
        todo/reading list. I also like to <a href="/projects">hack</a> around
        any daily inconveniences.
    </p>
    <p>
        I'm interested in an unlimited number of topics. But the few that stay
        constant are Sotware Engineering, Science, Philosophy, and Social studies. Currently reading 
        <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10483171-the-beginning-of-infinity" target="_blank">The Beginning of Infinity</a> and 
        <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44767458-dune" target="_blank">Dune</a>.

        Songs with great lyrics, an evening at the beach, and writing down help
        me detach, relax, and recharge.

        This is my third attempt at having an online presence. Previously, I've
        written at <a href="https://medium.com/@nvinayvarma189"
        target="_blank">Medium</a> and <a
        hre="https://roronoa189.wordpress.com/posts/"
        target="_blank">Wordpress</a>.
