        By profession, I do Platform ML work at <a href="https://skit.ai" target="_blank">Skit.ai</a>. It is a mix of
        Software Engineering and MLOps. In my spare time, I'm clearing my never ending
        todo/reading list. I like to <a href="/projects">hack</a> around
        any daily inconveniences.

        I consider myself to be curious and I have many fleeting interests. The few that stay
        constant are Software Engineering, Science, Efficiency, and Philosophy. Currently reading
        <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10483171-the-beginning-of-infinity" target="_blank">The Beginning
            of Infinity</a> and
        <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44767458-dune" target="_blank">Dune</a>.

        Songs with great lyrics, an evening at the beach, and writing down help
        me detach, relax, and recharge.

        This is my third attempt at having an online presence. Previously, I've
        written at <a href="https://medium.com/@nvinayvarma189" target="_blank">Medium</a> and <a
            hre="https://roronoa189.wordpress.com/posts/" target="_blank">Wordpress</a>.
