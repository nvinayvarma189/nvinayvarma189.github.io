                <p>"Hey listen!! you got this man. It's going to be fine, just be yourself", Pavan repeated on the phone. "Hmmm", Arvind nodded from the other side. "Be a gentleman and be confident", pavan continued. Arvind succumbed to his wandering mind and was lost in his thoughts. "You got this right?". Arvind didn't mumble a word. "RIGHT?", pavan shouted. That loud scream snapped out Arvind from his void and he replied, "Yeah, I go this!!". "Good, now you should be going else you'll be late", pavan ended the call.</p>

                <p>Arvind sighed and glanced at the mirror in front of him. The hair gel was miserable in holding down the erected strands of hair.</p>
                <p>He ran his fingers through those thick locks of hair attempting to adjust it. The golden hour rays crept in through the tiny slits on the curtains, lighting up the room before resting on Arvind's face. On a normal day, Arvind would've enjoyed basking in that warm sensation. But not today. It struck his senses that it is almost evening and he quickly tucked in the shirttails into his trousers, careful not to form any wrinkles.</p>
