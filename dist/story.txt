"Hey listen!! you got this man. It's going to be fine, just be yourself", Pavan repeated on the phone. "Hmmm", Arvind nodded from the other side. "Be a gentleman and be confident", pavan continued. Arvind succumbed to his wandering mind and was lost in his thoughts. "You got this right?". Arvind didn't mumble a word. "RIGHT?", pavan shouted. That loud scream snapped out Arvind from his void and he replied, "Yeah, I go this!!". "Good, now you should be going else you'll be late", pavan ended the call.

Arvind sighed and glanced at the mirror in front of him. The hair gel was miserable in holding down the erected strands of hair. He ran his fingers through those thick locks of hair attempting to adjust it. The golden hour rays crept in through the tiny slits on the curtains, lighting up the room before resting on Arvind's face. On a normal day, Arvind would've enjoyed basking in that warm sensation. But not today. It struck his senses that it is almost evening and he quickly tucked in the shirttails into his trousers, careful not to form any wrinkles.

One more glance at the mirror and he was still fretting over the date night. Trying to shake away the anxiety, he practiced his smile a couple of times and puffed up his slim body frame. Arvind carefully sneaked out of his room and grabbed his umbrella. He looked around the house and rushed towards the door before anyone could see him leaving. "Where is my little brother going?", questioned Geethika from behind. "Jeez.." exclaimed a surprised Arvind. Apparently, Geethika ditched her music class today. "Also, why are you dressed up so elaborately? a party?", she continued her probe. Arvind was mindful of the time and he continued walking towards the door with a blank face. "A date?", Geethika guessed. Arvind stood dead on his tracks. He rested his hand on the cold metallic handle of the front door. Turning back, he let out a nervous smile to dismiss her before leaving the house.

It was a serene evening in the city. The streets were buzzing with people walking around, yet lesser than the usual. The cotton candy clouds turned grey and came together, concealing the setting ball of fire. The sky was adorned with an orange tint with a pinch of reddish-pink. Arvind couldn't contain his awe at this stunning display of beauty while briskly walking to meet his date. The restaurant is just a few meters away from the lane he is walking on. It was right around the corner.

Arvind collided head-on with a man coming from the blind spot of the corner. "Oww!! god...JESUS!!" Arvind exclaimed in pain while holding his jarred head. The man was giant in size and cloaked in an oddly long length green cloth stretching from his neck to his ankles. Slightly mocking a patient gown. The man did not show the faintest hint of pain, his protruding eyes reflecting his impassive personality. "God Bless", he said in a placid tone of voice. Arvind caught hold of his swirling head and cleared his blurry vision to look at the man. "CUT", he said. "ACTION", he said. To Arvind's surprise, the man was at the other end of the lane, walking away from him. How is it possible for anyone to cover that distance within a few seconds? Arvind lost sight of the enigmatic man as he quickly vanished into the city dust.

Arvind reached the spot and slumped on one of the tables set up on the pavement, just outside the restaurant. The lavishly dressed restaurant was beaming with retro vibes and bright incandescent yellow bulbs were hanging out from the windows. The bricks on the pavement bore the cracks of ages which reiterated that the place is old and iconic. Arvind's thoughts kept him busy imagining how he would greet and welcome the lady. Should I pull back the chair for her and declare my mastery of chivalry? He was only afraid that she had already left the place after waiting for him.

A taxi pulled over by the pavement, interrupting an over-scrutinizing Arvind. It was the moment Arvind's heart slipped down. Malini got down from the cab and stood still. Her eyes searching for Arvind. She sported a gorgeous knee-length evening dress. It was a perfect decoration to her slender body as it tightly hugged her tapered hips. A puff of cool breeze caressed her brunette hair which plunged over her shoulders. Producing the magic of loose waves of an ocean. Her arched eyebrows only bowed down to her hypnotic, yet innocent almond-brown eyes. The jet black kohl perfectly complemented her bronze complexion. Arvind was spellbound watching her dignified walk while she balanced her grace and beauty. A blanket of strong fragrance enveloped Arvind as she approached the table. Malini settled down on the opposite chair and rested her chin on her hand. It was not long before Arvind realized that he missed pulling back the chair for her. He cursed his paralyzed body. Beads of sweat rolled down his ears. You look stunning and your eyes glitter brighter than those stars. Those dimples of yours, dangerous than quicksand. You just swept me off my feet, though I was sitting. Hehehe. All these words locked in his mouth, unable to escape his pressed lips.

"Hey, Did I make you wait for long?", asked Malini. "Umm...no, absolutely not.", Arvind chuckled. "Yeah, great. I'm hungry already. Shall we order something?", Malini continued. "Yup, sure", Arvind replied and signaled the waiter to take the order. Slowly, Arvind's anxiety drifted away. Both of them were engaged in a delightful exchange of stories, thoughts, and sentiments. Perhaps, the wine was the assassin of Arvind's jitters. The waiter returned to refill the glasses with freshly vinted red wine. While he was at the table filling up Malini's glass, a passing pedestrian bumped into the waiter. That accidental collision peeled off the waiter's grip on the wine bottle. The red liquid spilled from his hand and was accelerating to fall on Malini. It was happening fast, all in front of Arvind's eyes.  Unfortunately, he is incapable of reacting within a split second. "CUT", a man yelled from Arvind's back. "ACTION", he said. No one could comprehend what happened at that moment. Arvind was shocked to find himself drenched in wine. He was baffled at this seemingly impossible and unexplained event. Arvind stood up and twisted in the direction of the voice. There was the enigmatic man sitting in a deserted corner, a couple of tables behind Arvind. Yet again, Arvind couldn't see his face as he was facing the other side. But Arvind could capture one detail this time. A medium-sized clapperboard tattoo on the back of his neck. "OMG...Are you okay?" asked a concerned Malini. Arvind turned back to her and smiled to convey that he is fine, although he was definitely disappointed as his favorite shirt is now spoiled. "Goddammit!!!", he softly cursed.

Malini rose to her feet and reached out for Arvind to help him clean the mess. She pulled out a hankie from her bag and brought it close to Arvind's face. Reading Arvind's clueless expression, she placed her hand on his left shoulder and began caressing his face with the hankie. An unprepared and obviously surprised Arvind's heart was bouncing in infinite directions. A jolt of electric current passed through Arvind's spine every time he felt Malini's breath on his forehead. Contrastingly, he is now thankful that the wine spilled on him instead. Blissful of her gesture, Arvind expressed his gratitude and insisted Malini be seated.

The night grew colder. The tables and the pavement were coated with a thin layer of snow precipitated from the mist of the air. Everything except Malini faded away for Arvind's being. Her dulcet voice is of envy to a nightingale. The emotions resumed. A sense of comfort resonated with both of them, marking the birth of intimacy with each other. 'THERE HE IS!!! Catch him!!", a loud cry thundered across the street, breaking the abyssal chat between Arvind and Malini. Arvind peeked over Malini's shoulder to find four security men charging towards him. He was disoriented at this sight and began to panic for he didn't recognize any of them. As they came closer, it was evident that Arvind was not their interest. They ran past him. Arvind twisted around to see them dashing towards the man of mystery. This time Arvind did not miss it. "CUT", the man said. "ACTION", he said. Those four security men are gone. Vanished and nowhere to be found. That man still remained pinned to his chair. He did not move a muscle. Now, it was safe for Arvind to conclude that this man is capable of supernatural things. Malini was an observer too, but she is no believer in delusions and is more deeply rooted in reality. She couldn't care less about what she witnessed. However for Arvind, the questions "Who is this man and what is happening when he screams CUT and ACTION?" haunted him. A rumbling sound reverberated as the clouds wrestled against each other. A soft drizzle leaked from above and it was time for Malini to leave.

Arvind's umbrella wouldn't open until after a couple of jounces. He was expectant that Malini would join him and he prayed so. Malini slid her hand into the bag scanning for her umbrella. It was an obvious conclusion for Arvind to make that she brought her own umbrella. His hope dampened. And then it happened again. "CUT", he said. "ACTION", he said. Malini's umbrella went missing!!. She looked in again and again. But she was only left with the option to convince herself that, she forgot it at home. Who on earth is this man? What is he doing to us? What is with this CUT and ACTION thing? An endless chain of questions ran through Arvind's mind. "But whatever has happened, it only brought us closer and closer", Arvind thought to himself. That was enough a reason for him to not go gaga over the mysterious man and he shrugged. Malini reached his side under the umbrella. Holding hands. Arvind's happiness knew no boundaries, it was a one-way ticket to Euphoria. Arvind thanked god for the day as they turned around the corner. "God bless", the man grinned.
